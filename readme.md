# **Accordion FAQ — Minimal Documentation**

- **Project:** A small interactive FAQ accordion built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Quick Tips**
- **Open an item:** Click the question heading to toggle the answer.
- **Close others:** Keep only one item open by ensuring script toggles classes.
- **Edit content:** Update question/answer HTML directly in `index.html`.
- **Change styling:** Modify `style.css` colors, spacing, or transitions.
- **Animation speed:** Adjust the CSS `transition` duration for faster/slower effects.

**Customization ideas**
- Add icons for open/closed states.
- Animate height with max-height and overflow for smooth transitions.
- Persist open state using `localStorage` if desired.

**Contributing / Next steps**
- Make small incremental changes and test in-browser.


Small, focused tips above should make it easy to use and extend this project.
